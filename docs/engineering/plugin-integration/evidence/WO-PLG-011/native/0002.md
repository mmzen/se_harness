# Verification Record Candidate

This ready record binds retained evidence for `WO-EVD-001` to candidate commit `d2f0f0e8e76b31fcca5eb89215bf1cde92a099f7`. An accountable assurance owner must review the evidence and transition the record to `verified`; this command did not approve, commit, tag, release, or publish anything.

The record is intentionally created after the candidate commit it names, avoiding self-referential commit metadata.
