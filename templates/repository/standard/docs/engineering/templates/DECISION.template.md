# Decision: <title>

## Question

State the question once, then the facts a decider needs and nothing else.

## Options

One paragraph per option: what it means, what it costs, what it forecloses.

## Recommendation

Which option, and why, in two or three sentences.

## Disposition

Written by `harnessctl decide`; do not edit by hand. The `[disposition]`
table records the option, its label, the role, the time and the verbatim
reason. A `deferred` decision records its scope and revisit trigger. An
accepted deviation records its revisit trigger and stays visible on the
departed specification, the work order and the records until the rule
changes.
